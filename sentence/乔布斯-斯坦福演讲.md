## 乔布斯-斯坦福演讲

So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and **she decided to put me up for adoption**.

我为什么要退学呢？故事要从我还未出生讲起。我的生母是一个年轻的，没有结婚的大学毕业生，因此她决定让别人收养我。

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that **was almost as expensive as Stanford**, and **all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition**.

在十七岁那年，我真的上了大学。当时我很天真，选择了一所几乎和斯坦福大学一样贵的学校。我的父母是工人，他们几乎把所有积蓄都花在了我的学费上面。

After six months, **I couldn't see the value in it**. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here **I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life**.

读了六个月后，我却看不到读书的价值所在。我既不知道我一辈子想要做什么，也不清楚大学是否能帮助我找到答案，但我几乎花光了我父母这一辈子的所有积蓄。

It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back **it was one of the best decisions I ever made**.

当时做出这个决定确实是非常的害怕，但是现在回想起来，这的确是我一生中做的最棒的一个决定。

Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, **I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this**.

我因为退学了，不用正常上课，所以决定去参加书法课程，好好学学写字。



---



**I learned about serif and san serif typefaces**, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about **what makes great typography great**.

我学会了带衬线和不带衬线的字体，根据不同字母调整间距以及怎样把版式调的很漂亮。

**None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.** But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.

当时我并不指望书法能有什么实际应用的价值。但是十年之后，当我们在设计第一台Macintosh电脑的时候，所学的一切都浮现在我的眼前。我把这些东西全都设计进了Mac。那是第一台有这么漂亮的文字版式的电脑。

**So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.**

所以你要相信这些片断会在你未来的某一天串连起来。你必须要相信你的直觉、归宿、生活和命运。

**Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.**

因为相信这些点滴会串成前行的道路能给你跟从内心的自信，让你远离平凡，变得与众不同。
